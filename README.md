This is most definitely not a Twitter clone.

This practice repo is designed for frontend testing practice DOM manipulation and Ajax calls. This assignment will focus on writing asynchronous tests and tests that require specific pieces of HTML to execute. This assignment will help with the basic understandings of HTML fixtures, how to set them up, and how to use a fake server for Ajax testing.

The initial files were forked from Jordan Kasper and then cloned to my own repo to begin work.

## Terminal Commands:
```sh
  npm init

  npm install mocha --save-dev

  npm install --save-dev karma chai karma-mocha karma-chai karma-chrome-launcher

  ./node_modules/karma/bin/karma start conf.js

  npm install sinon --save-dev

  npm test
```
